Crackcode is a CrossCode mod designed to speed up the game for a faster experience, designed with Prepare to Hi modifier and Arena in mind.

Important: If a crash occurs or the game breaks, it is 99% because of Short Cinematics settings, which causes crashes during multiple story sequences.

Features:

Instant death, no death effects.

Instant arena restart.


Configurable:

Auto-Skip Cutscenes - Automatically skips cutscenes, even those the game normally prevents you from skipping.

Skip Arena Score Counting - Upon defeating last enemy skips the arena score tally sequence and starts the next round immediately.

Short Cinematics – Makes in-game events instant, such as "Once more" death save, but can cause crashes in many story sequences.

Instant-transitions – Makes area and death transitions instant. Somewhat disruptive outside of the Arena
